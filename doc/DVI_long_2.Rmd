```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

If there are multiple missing persons in a family, like in the case based on the file
[FamilyWith3Missing.fam](https://familias.name/dviapp/FamilyWith3Missing.fam), 
which is similar to a built-in-case,
the number of missing must be specified in `Settings`, (`No missing: 3`),
and the missing persons must be named
`M1`, `M2`,...(this is the case in the fam-file linked above).
