```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Priority power is calculated by uploading a Familias file. Here's an example file:
[BrotherPriority.fam](https://familias.name/dviapp/BrotherPriority.fam).
The missing person should be named `MP`, the reference `REF`, and the extra candidates
for genotyping `E1`and `E2`. The mentioned file gives output similar to that
in `Priority > Explanations` (but not identical, even for the same seed, since this is simulation).
