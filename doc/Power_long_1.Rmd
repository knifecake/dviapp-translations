LR comparing H1: `MP and REF full brothers`, versus H2: `MP and REF` unrelated,
has been computed for 1000 simulations of MP and REF conditioned on H1 below.
The simulations use the 35 markers in the database `NorwegianFrequencies` 
documented in the R library forrel. In `Power > Analyses based on built in cases` some prepared
cases can be run and parameters like the number of markers, 
can  be changed. In `Power > Analyses based on user loaded data`, 
similar output is obtained by loading a familias file
prepared by the user. The simulations will be conditioned on genotyped individuals, if any.
