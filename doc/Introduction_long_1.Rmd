```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```

This app deals with Disaster Victim Identification (DVI) problems and power 
calculation for kinship problems. Our goal has been to make  available functionality
in the `pedsuite` of R libraries and also the `dvir` library. We also expand on functionality 
in the [Familias software](https://www.familias.no).
There are tree modules, all based on built in cases or user data (Familias or R files):

* Power: Simulations can be done to determine if goals are likely to be achieved. 
* Priority: The aim is to find the optimal extra persons to genotype.  
* DVI: Methods to include or exclude missing persons are provided.
